I was born and raised in the **Siberian** part of Russia, and so, as a walking stereotype, I absolutely hate hot weather.

I studied and graduated with honors with a degree in Economics from USC, after which I attended a software development bootcamp and got my first job in tech as a Software Engineer!

Since then, I had a long career in tech, and got a chance to work with some of the most wonderful people on solving incredibly complex and interesting problems using various technologies, tools, and methodologies.

Now I care the most about working in a value-oriented organization, in a team that values and celebrates diversity, close collaboration, and empathy. I'm highly effective and focus on delivering concrete results without sacrificing quality and while supporting the folks on my team.
